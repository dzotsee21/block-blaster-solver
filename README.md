# Block Blast Solver Program  

This is a **simple Block Blast solver program**. While it performs well in most scenarios, it may make not so good moves in highly complex games.

## Running the Program  

To run the program, execute the following command in your terminal:  
```bash
python run.py
```

# Making Changes
If you modify **solver.cpp** file and need to rebuild it for Python integration, use this command:
```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements to enhance its performance.
